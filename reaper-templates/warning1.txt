Hello, 

I am the AWSBOX Reaper. 

This is your first warning that your AWSBOX: 

    ==INSTANCE_NAME== 

will be terminated in 48 hours.


To add an extra week to your AWSBOX use this command: 

    > awsbox spare ==INSTANCE_ID==


To have me ignore the box forever use this command:

    > awsbox NOKILL ==INSTANCE_ID==


If you do not need it anymore please ignore this warning and 
I'll take care of it. 

Thank you. 
AWSBOX Reaper.
